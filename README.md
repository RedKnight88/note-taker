## Description

This Note Taker application is a place to quickly store server-side virtual notes. Keeping track of tasks, details, or ideas is much easier when you have an accessible website that will quickly store your thoughts. Access them later by clicking around on the sleek and simple interface. This project is deployed utilizing NodeJS and ExpressJS to create a backend server, and I learned how to create my own API with a modularized organization.

## Usage
This application is very straight-forward and easy to use. Typing up the notes will reveal the clear form and save note buttons. Saving the note will add it to the list on the lefthand side, where clicking on the note in the list will bring it back to focus on the right with the full text. Also, there is a deletion button (trash can icon) which will remove a note from the list.
